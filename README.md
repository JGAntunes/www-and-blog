# Website & blog

This is my personal website made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and based on the [codex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-codex/). It's still a WIP but it's main goal is to be as simple and as easy to maintain as possible.

## Developing

```sh
hugo server
```

## Compiling

```sh
hugo
```
